        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds pork shoulder, cut into several large pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
<h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <p>Step 1:</p>
        <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season pork shoulder pieces with salt, then arrange in the Dutch oven. Cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Step 2:</p>
        <p>Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until pork is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p>Step 3:</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        <p>Step 4:</p>
        <p>Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid. Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pork pieces and lightly season with salt.</p>
        <p>Step 5:</p>
        <p>Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork as it browns.</p>
        <p>Step 6:</p>
        <p>ENJOY!</p>
